## Project Introduction
Credit risk team is facing a problem an upcrease in loan defaults among younger applicants and those with limited employment history. There is a need for a tool to be able to differentiate between high-risk and low-risk borrowers within key customer segments.The goal is to make smarter, data-driven decisions about who to lend to, under what terms, and with what level of risk. 

By building a **Power BI dashboard** using credit reference data, the analytics team can uncover patterns in age, income, employment length, and historical defaults—helping stakeholders visualize risk across borrower profiles and loan types. 

This project aims to reduce default rates, improve customer targeting, and align lending practices with strategic goals. **This project is created with synthetic data and a fictional story**

## Dataset Information
This dataset simulates credit reference agency data and was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data) for the purposes of this project. It contains anonymized records of loans, including key variables such as applicant age, income, employment length, home ownership status, loan intent, loan grade, interest rate, and historical default indicators.
